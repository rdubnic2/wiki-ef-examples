## Fall 2019 HTRC Workshop materials
Code and documentation for Extracted Features examples used on HTRC wiki
* `ef-examples-2020.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook with Python code illustrating some example tasks/use cases that can be achieved using the HTRC Extracted Features dataset
* `ef-wiki-examples-data`: a directory with Extracted Features files used in the EF examples notebook, though having the files downloaded is not required.
